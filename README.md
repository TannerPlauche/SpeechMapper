# This is an experiment combining the web audio api and machine learning / artificial intelligence in the browser

## Currently a hot mess of code. This is version is part of the learning process.

### No transpiling needed.

### There is currently no stored model. If you train for all current vowel training data, it takes at least 30 minutes.
### If you train for minimal pairs (two vowels), only 5-10 minutes needed to train model.
